<p>
First developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Language.<br/> HTML is used to create electronic documents (called pages) that are displayed on the World Wide Web.<br/> Each page contains a series of connections to other pages called hyperlinks.
</p>

<p>HTML code ensures the proper formatting of text and images for your Internet browser.<br/> Without HTML, a browser would not know how to display text as elements or load images or other elements.<br/> HTML also provides a basic structure of the page, upon which Cascading Style Sheets are overlaid to change its appearance.<br/> One could think of HTML as the bones (structure) of a web page, and CSS as its skin (appearance).
